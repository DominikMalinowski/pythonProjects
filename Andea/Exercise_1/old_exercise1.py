"""
Ask the user for a number.
Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Implement also check if user put the number or string.

Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check).
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
