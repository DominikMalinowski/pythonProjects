Write a program that:
1. Creates a new file named 'data.txt' in the same directory as your program (check if it already doesn't exist) - use relative path!
2. Opens the file in write mode and writes three words (e.g. 'one', 'two', 'three') to it - each one in new line
3. Opens the file in read mode and reads all the lines, putting each word to list as a new element
4. Deletes the created file
