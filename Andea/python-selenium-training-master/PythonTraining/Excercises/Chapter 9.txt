Write a program that:
1. Creates two new files ('f1.txt' and 'f2.txt') in the same directory as your program (you can use code from Chapter 8)
2. Copies these files to the same directory but with different names ('f1-copy.txt' and 'f2-copy.txt')
3. Deletes files 'f1.txt' and 'f2.txt'
4. Creates a .zip file with added files 'f1-copy.txt' and 'f2-copy.txt'
